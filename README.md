#Android Coding Test:
Develop a simple News app which display latest news headlines (with
image, short description and date/time) on first screen, and when
you tap on any news headline it should take you to second screen
which will display full image, description, and date/time etc. On
second screen if you can give options like share and favourite in the
toolbar with Icons that will be a bonus.
You can choose any news API, which are freely available online to
use.
#Language, tools, and libraries:
Kotlin: use of null safety, scope functions, Coroutines etc.
DI: Dagger-Hilt
Architecture: MVVM
Testing: Unit test cases, UI test cases
For UI: Use constraint layout
Android jetpack components: Lifecycle, livedata, navigation, data binding etc.
Retrofit for parsing network response.
If you can implement functionalities like pull to refresh the news
feeds and paging that will be a bonus.
Please create Git repo with proper commit history and share the
GitHub link/zip file once completed.# TCS
